        <p class="lead ma-5">
          Ticketing kiosks are a common sight near the entrace of metro stations in Taipei, Taiwan. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead ma-5">
          While frequent passengers typically use a metro card to beep themselves in and out of the station gates, ticketing
          kiosks are provided for those who do not have a metro card and/or are seeking to purchase a one-way ticket.
        </p>
        <p class="lead ma-5">
          Here's how it works: First, touch the screen to start and you would then be presented with a wide selection of ticket 
          prices and ticket numbers. Selecting the desired price and ticket number prompts a price amount to appear on the right hand 
          side of the screen. Then, after paying the corresponding amount, the ticket would be dropped into the ticket box below.
