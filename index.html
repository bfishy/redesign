                    the stop she wants on the fare map; the words and numbers are too small to read from and was the step that took her

                  <h5 class="subquestion">
                    The process of figuring out how to buy a ticket from the kiosk "was okay". He thinks that while it doesn't require a lot of steps, 
                    the English version of the interface was presented as a mix of Madarin annotated with English, with the English portion 
                    being significantly smaller and therfore harder to read.

                  <h5 class="subquestion">
                    He also thinks that the most difficult step was figuring out what ticket price to select based on the fare map. The fare map is messy and 
                    unorganized for a first-time rider, as he doesn't know which line/area his stop is on/in. Having small english names for stop names only made it harder.
